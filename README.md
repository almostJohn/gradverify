The codebase will be removed once it has been forked enough times to preserve its accessibility for those interested. This is to retain the original commit history without associating it with later inconsistent or AI-generated changes that no longer reflect the intended development standards.

You’re welcome to fork and continue on your own. Please respect the original structure and standards if you reference it.
